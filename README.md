# Deep Reinforcement Learning in Rust

## Overview

This project implements a collection of **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** algorithms in Rust.  
It provides a modular architecture for training, evaluating, and comparing various model-based and model-free methods across several custom environments.

## Features

### ‚úÖ Implemented Algorithms

**Model-Based:**
- Expert Apprentice
- Monte Carlo

**Model-Free:**
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- Q-Learning
- REINFORCE
- SARSA

### üåç Environments
- Line World
- Grid World
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Bobail (African traditional game)

## Requirements

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (Stable)
- [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) *(Optional, for GPU acceleration)*
- Ensure `libtorch` environment variables are properly configured if using CUDA
